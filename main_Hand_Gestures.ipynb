        "It's a topic in computer science with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Hand gestures recognition as an typical form of the recognition is used to control or interact with devices without physically touching them. There are several ways to do this, but we focus on processing images and videos using deep learning.\n",
